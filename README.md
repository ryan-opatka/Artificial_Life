Artificial Life CS 396 Repo 

For the final, look in the folder final_code and change it to be your current working directory.

If you would like to evolve your own set of things and plot a fitness curve, simply run main.py after downloading the necessary packages.

If you would like to check out some already generated organisms, run test.py and follow the prompt!

Here is a link to the video!

Homework 1:

Basic xml file creation!

Randomly generate a genotype that influences a phenotype. Tosee how this works, look at the final project folder and check out genotype.py and gen_worm.py

Homework 3:

We now are using a fitness calculation to select the best organism out of many randomly generated ones. In the final project folder, look at gen1.py and genotype.py!

This randomly generates the first generation of organisms, evaluate them, then it will select the best of them and display it.

Homework 4:

Now we can mutate. This allows us to evaluate generations, select them, and produce offspring with mutations! Much better behavior seen now.

Check out the mutate function in genotype.py in the final project folder. Also, look at evolve.py to see how I do this across generations!

Thank you.
